Physical fitness refers to good body health. It is dependent on genetic determinators and also on social, economic and ecological factors.

Feeling capable and efficient; being able to handle normal levels of stress, have good friends and family, and lead an independent life; and being able to \"bounce back,\" or recover from hardships, are all signs of mental health.   Public health refers to trying to stop a disease that is unhealthy to the community, and does not help in long life or promote your health. This is fixed by organized efforts and choices of society, public and private clubs, communities and individuals. It is about the health of many people, or everybody, rather than one person. Public health stops instead of encouraging a disease through surveillance of cases. To prevent being sick, it is good to act according to some simple advice: Hand washing, regular check-ups, vaccination programmes, clean water and using condoms. When infectious diseases break out, washing hands for about 30 seconds may be especially important. Sometimes it is necessary to avoid masses of people or wear a surgical mask to protect yourself and to stop the spreading of the disease.

Clothing is far more than just a means to protect our bodies.   There is no easy way to be sure when clothing was first developed, because it was prehistoric and clothing is perishable. After disobeying God in the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve made clothing out of fig leaves when they realized about their nudity. God subsequently made tunics using animal fur when he banished them from Eden. Some information comes from studying lice. The body louse lives in clothing, and diverged from head lice about 107,000 years ago. This suggests that clothing existed at that time. Another theory is that modern humans are the only survivors of several species of primates who may have worn clothes, and that clothing may have been used as long ago as 650 thousand years ago. Other louse-based estimates put the introduction of clothing at around 42,000\u201372,000 BC. A cloak made of the fur of squirrels, from a cave in Italy, has been dated to 23.000 years BP, and is possibly among the oldest items of clothing.  People often decorate their bodies with makeup or perfume, and they also cut or change the hair on their heads and faces. They might also go in for body modification: tattoos, scarifications, and body piercings. But makeup and tattoos are not kinds of clothing. Things that are carried and not worn, like wallets, purses, canes, and umbrellas, are called accessories, but they are not kinds of clothing, either. Jewelry and eyeglasses are also accessories that are put on the body. Nail polish is also put on the fingertips and can be interpreted as makeup.

[[Human]]s are the only [[animal]]s which wear clothing, and all people do wear suitable clothing.\n\nThe [[torso]] (body) can be covered by [[shirt]]s, [[arm]]s by sleeves, [[leg]]s by [[pants]] or [[skirt]]s, hands by [[glove]]s, feet by [[footwear]], and [[head]] by [[Hat|headgear]] or [[mask]]s.  In cold climates, people also wear heavy, thick [[coat]]s such as [[trenchcoat]]s.\n\nClothing protects the human body from the hot sun and high [[temperature]]s in warm [[tropics|tropical]] countries.  Clothing such as thick wool [[coat]]s and boots keeps the human body warm in very cold [[temperature]]s (such as in the [[arctic]]). To some extent, clothing protects people from damage to their body.\n\nClothing is also worn for decoration, as a [[fashion (clothing)]]. People from different [[culture]]s wear different clothing, and have different beliefs and customs about what type of clothing should be worn.\nFor many people, clothing is a status symbol. It helps people project an image. Often, clothing is a form of self-expression. Adults in different social or work situations present different views of themselves by the clothes they wear. Young people have an entirely different form of dress to express their personalities. Often people will simply follow popular fashion styles so that they will fit in. Clothing is far more than just a means to protect our bodies.\n\n==Origin of clothing==\nThere is no easy way to be sure when clothing was first developed, because it was [[Pre-history|prehistoric]] and clothing is perishable. After disobeying God in the [[Garden of Eden]], [[Adam and Eve]] made clothing out of fig leaves when they realized about their nudity. God subsequently made tunics using animal fur when he banished them from Eden.<ref>http:\/\/www.jtsa.edu\/the-garments-of-adam-and-eve<\/ref> Some information comes from studying [[lice]]. The [[body louse]] lives in clothing, and diverged from [[head lice]] about 107,000 years ago. This suggests that clothing existed at that time.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Ralf Kittler, Manfred Kayser & Mark Stoneking |journal=Current Biology |volume=13 |pages=1414\u20131417 |year=2003 |title=Molecular evolution of ''Pediculus humanus'' and the origin of clothing |url=http:\/\/www.eva.mpg.de\/genetics\/pdf\/Kittler.CurBiol.2003.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |doi=10.1016\/S0960-9822(03)00507-4 |pmid=12932325|issue=16}}<\/ref><ref name=\"Stoneking\">{{cite web |url= http:\/\/www.current-biology.com\/content\/article\/fulltext?uid=PIIS0960982204009856|last= Stoneking|first= Mark|title= Erratum: Molecular evolution of ''Pediculus humanus'' and the origin of clothing |accessdate=March 24, 2008}}<\/ref><ref>[http:\/\/mbe.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/28\/1\/29.full \"...Lice Indicates Early Clothing Use ...\"], Mol Biol Evol (2011) 28 (1): 29-32.<\/ref> Another theory is that modern humans are the only survivors of several species of [[primate]]s who may have worn clothes,<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Reed\n|first=David\n|title=Pair of lice lost or parasites regained: The evolutionary history of Anthropoid primate lice\n|publisher=BMC Biology\n|year=2007\n}}<\/ref>  and that clothing may have been used as long ago as 650 thousand years ago.

They might also go in for [[body modification]]: [[tattoo]]s, [[scarification]]s, and [[body piercing]]s. But makeup and tattoos are not kinds of clothing.\n\nThings that are carried and not worn, like [[wallet]]s, [[purse]]s, [[cane]]s, and [[umbrella]]s, are called [[accessories]], but they are not kinds of clothing, either.

Columbus thought that Ta\u00edno was the name of the people. Rouse divides the Ta\u00ednos into three main groups. One is the Classic Ta\u00edno, from Hispaniola and Puerto Rico. Another is the Western Ta\u00edno or sub-Ta\u00edno, from Jamaica, Cuba (except for the western tip of the island) and the Bahamas. The third is the Eastern Ta\u00edno, from the Virgin Islands to Montserrat. The Ta\u00ednos of the Bahamas were known as the '\"Lucayan\". (At that time, the Bahamas were called the Lucayas). Lucayos were Ta\u00ednos, but their culture was less developed. Archeologists call them \"sub-Ta\u00ednos\".  The Ta\u00ednos' ancestors went from the center of the Amazon Basin to the Orinoco Valley. From there, they went through Guyana and Venezuela and got to the Caribbean islands. A different theory says that the Ta\u00ednos' ancestors came from the Colombian Andes. The Ta\u00edno culture developed in the Greater Antilles.       Ta\u00edno society was divided into two classes. There were the naborias (common people) and the nita\u00ednos (nobles). Both classes were governed by chiefs known as caciques. The caciques could be either male or female. There were also bohiques (medicine men). The Ta\u00ednos lived in villages called yucayeques. The villages in the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico were the largest. The villages in the Bahamas were the smallest. The Ta\u00ednos built large round houses called bohio, where several families lived. The cacique and his family lived in a rectangular house called caney. People slept on cotton hammocks (hamacas). The Ta\u00ednos often played a ball game called batey. Batey was also the name of the place where they played and had dances. The cacique sat on a chair of wood called duho, or dujo.   Angler\u00eda, Pedro M\u00e1rtir de (1949).

Jay Gatsby also hosts many expensive parties frequently. Strangely, he never participates in his own parties; because of this, many rumors are formed as to Gatsby's true identity and background. Nick drives out to visit his cousin Daisy in East Egg. There, he meets her husband, Tom Buchanan. He is also introduced to her friend, Jordan Baker. Nick learns from her that Tom has been having an affair with Myrtle Wilson. Nick decides to hold his judgment. Later in the summer, Nick is invited to one of Gatsby's parties. There, he meets Gatsby himself, a young and charming man. Nick learns that Gatsby was once in a romantic relationship with Daisy, many years ago. Gatsby is still in love with her, and spends many nights looking at the green light from Daisy's dock across his mansion. He is hoping that he could impress Daisy with his rich lifestyle and wild parties. Gatsby grew up very poor and with little opportunity to move up in the world, and this motivated him to pursue wealth to reinvent himself and become worthy of being with Daisy. Gatsby asks Nick to arrange for Daisy and him to meet. Nick invites them both over for tea, and they begin to fall in love again. They then start an affair with one another. After a short time, Tom notices that Daisy and Gatsby are in love. The group meets at a hotel, where Daisy is forced to choose between Gatsby and Tom. She chooses Tom, and the group begins to drive home. Along the way, Daisy, driving Gatsby's car, accidentally hits and kills Myrtle. Gatsby tells Nick that he will take the blame in order to save Daisy. Later, he is then shot dead by Myrtle's husband, George, believing that Gatsby was the one responsible. George then kills himself. Nick holds a funeral for Gatsby, but very few people show up despite Gatsby having been famous. Angry and sad about everything that has happened, Nick decides to leave New York to move back to the Midwest.

There are many different acts in circuses. Some people do acrobatics and gymnastics. Often a group of gymnasts will finish up standing on top of one another in a pyramid. The gymnasts may also do jumping acts on trampolines. Some people are jugglers, throwing things in the air and catching them. There may be people who walk on stilts or who ride on unicycles. They may perform magic which may include swordswallowing, knife throwing or fireeating. There are always clowns who do funny things to make people laugh. They trip over things and fall over, throw buckets of water over one another or put custard pies into one another\u2019s faces. Sometimes these clowns are also very skilful acrobats, musicians or jugglers. They may pretend to be stupid at first, but they often show that they are very clever.       During the last two centuries, and until recently, the modern circus used many kinds of animals. There were wild animals such as lions, tigers or bears. There may also have been camels, horses, elephants, sea lions and domestic animals such as dogs. In recent years people have changed their ideas. They think that it is unkind to make wild animals perform tricks that are unnatural to them. Many of their trainers used cruel methods to teach these animals to do tricks, e.g. hitting the animals, giving them electric shocks or causing pain in other ways. The animals were always touring around, living in tiny cages. Many countries now do not want to see wild animals in circuses.  In Ancient Rome the circus was a round or oval building for showing horse and chariot races, horse shows, staged battles, acts with animals, jugglers and acrobats. The Roman circus had tiered seats. The important people sat at the bottom, near the action. The Latin word circus comes from the Greek word kirkos, meaning \u201ccircle\" or \"ring\u201d. The first circus in Rome was the Circus Maximus, in the valley between the Palatine and Aventine hills. At first it was made of wood. It was rebuilt several times; the last building of the Circus Maximus could seat 250,000 people. After the period when Rome was powerful, Europe did not have a circus tradition. In China there were shows with acrobatic performances, but they did not influence the Western circus, which started to be popular towards the end of the 18th century. In London there were circuses with horse-riding. These were started in 1768 by Philip Astley. A \u201cRoyal Circus\u201d was set up in Lambeth, London by John Hughes. Circuses grew in size and had lots of animals. They were a bit like a zoo. They had wild animals such as lions and elephants. In 1793 a circus building was opened in Philadelphia, USA. Circuses became popular in the USA, especially the circus of Dan Rice. In 1840 Thomas Cooke brought his circus with horses from the USA to England. The circus started to become popular in many countries all over the world. The Barnum & Bailey Greatest Show On Earth toured from 1897 to 1902. They showed animal acts and human acts. There were even shows with freaks (people who were physically unusual, e.g. dwarfs and giants). During most of the 20th century this is what circuses were mostly like. In 1919, Lenin, head of the USSR, said he wanted the circus to be treated as a serious art form, just like opera and ballet. The Moscow Circus School, which was started in 1927, is still one of the best circuses today. The artists are very skilful acrobats, gymnasts etc. Chinese circuses also have artists who are some of the world\u2019s best gymnasts.

The Alkane's general formula is C<sub>n<\/sub>H<sub>2n+2<\/sub>.\n\nThese are some alkanes:\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Methane]] (CH<sub>4<\/sub>)\n* [[Ethane]] (C<sub>2<\/sub>H<sub>6<\/sub>)\n* [[Propane]] (C<sub>3<\/sub>H<sub>8<\/sub>)\n* [[Butane]] (C<sub>4<\/sub>H<sub>10<\/sub>)\n* [[Pentane]] (C<sub>5<\/sub>H<sub>12<\/sub>)\n* [[Hexane]] (C<sub>6<\/sub>H<sub>14<\/sub>)\n* [[Heptane]] (C<sub>7<\/sub>H<sub>16<\/sub>)\n* [[Octane]] (C<sub>8<\/sub>H<sub>18<\/sub>)\n* [[Nonane]] (C<sub>9<\/sub>H<sub>20<\/sub>)\n* [[Decane]] (C<sub>10<\/sub>H<sub>22<\/sub>)\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Undecane]] (C<sub>11<\/sub>H<sub>24<\/sub>)\n* [[Dodecane]] (C<sub>12<\/sub>H<sub>26<\/sub>)\n* [[Tridecane]] (C<sub>13<\/sub>H<sub>28<\/sub>)\n* [[Tetradecane]] (C<sub>14<\/sub>H<sub>30<\/sub>)\n* [[Pentadecane]] (C<sub>15<\/sub>H<sub>32<\/sub>)\n* [[Hexadecane]] (C<sub>16<\/sub>H<sub>34<\/sub>)\n* [[Heptadecane]] (C<sub>17<\/sub>H<sub>36<\/sub>)\n* [[Octadecane]] (C<sub>18<\/sub>H<sub>38<\/sub>)\n* [[Nonadecane]] (C<sub>19<\/sub>H<sub>40<\/sub>)\n* [[Icosane]] (C<sub>20<\/sub>H<sub>42<\/sub>)\n{{col-end}}\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Crude oil.JPG|thumb|213x213px|A sample of crude oil, containing alkanes.]]\nAlkanes come from [[crude oil]].
